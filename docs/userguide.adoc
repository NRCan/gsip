Introduction
------------

The GSIP mediator service is a simple LOD (Linked Open Data) resolution
service for persistent identifiers.  Its role it to provide a description of a
Non-Information URI (URI that represents "things" as an hypermedia document (HTML, RDF/XML, TTL and JSON-LD)
linking this resource to information resources (actual document) in various
formats and links to other non-information resources.

GSIP stands for Groundwater Surface water Interoperability Pilot.  (TODO: maybe
the application should be rename `gclod` or something like this). This application implements the Linked Open Data architecture designed for this project.

== GSIP service

The GSIP LOD architecture recognises three kinds of resources :

* `Things`, or "real world things", are also named "Non-information Resource" because it's not about information, but about something that exists in the real world.
* `Information` which is a document describing the real world `thing`.
* `representation` of this real world thing: a picture, a document, a dataset, etc.

GSIP is a service that provides access to a catalog of `things` and return `information` about them.
The catalog contains essentially two kind of information:

  * relations between `things` and other `things`
	* relations between `things` and their `representations`

== URI

All resources (`thing`, `information`, `representation`) are resources identified on the web using a URI (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier[Uniform Resource Identifier]).
A URI is both an identifier and a location (making them URL : Universal Resource Locator), which can be used to access a representation from the web.

=== Things

By GSIP convention, `things` URI are structured as such

`http(s)://{domain}/id/{category}/{item}`

`/id/` is not a requirement to represent `things`, but it a mandatory syntax for GSIP with the current architecture.  The presence of `/id/` tells GSIP that this resources is a `thing`.
This is a functional decision to efficiently manage request to the GSIP service. See <<Annex A : Change URI pattern>> to modify the default URI patterns.

==== Example

A real world catchment is assigned a GSIP URI

https://geoconnex.ca/id/catchment/02OJ*CE

This URI represents a `thing`.  It is not a document or a dataset, but the real catchment.  If you use this URI in a browser, you obviously won't download the catchment itself.
In GSIP infrastructure, you will be redirected using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_303[HTTP 303] to an `information` document.

This `information` resource provided by GSIP has the same URI structure except the `/id/` is replaced by `/info/`.

`http(s)://{domain}/info/{category}/{item}`

eg: https://geoconnex.ca/info/catchment/02OJ*CE

This is a document that can be downloaded from the web.

=== Info resource

The info resource, or info page if its format is in HTML,  is a description of a `thing`.  It provides two categories of information.

* relations between this `thing` and other `things`
* relations between this `thing` and its `representations`

It also provides other ancillary information, such as labels, mime-types, types, etc, as convenience for users or client applications.  For GSIP, the HTML representation of this information is the Non-Information Resource landing page : what a browser will get it a NIR is dereferenced.

=== Representations

Representations are fuzzy concepts.  They are a mixture of "data models" and formats.  Many documents on the web can provide information about a real `thing`.  For a catchment, we can find wiki pages, HTML page from a watershed authority, a XML file with relevant data, or a plain text file.
All those documents are *representations*. Representations are often conflated with the concept of format.

In the context of GSIP, a representation equates to an information model.  The same information model (or data model) can be encoded in multiple formats in such as way that each of the formats can be converted into another one within the same representation.
In a ideal world, the conversion would be perfect (no information loss), but in reality, not all formats have the same expressiveness.  For some formats, it's acceptable to assume the same representation if it's a reasonable subset, or simplification, of the same information model.

For example, a GWML document can be expressed in GML/XML or RDF/TTL without any significant information loss, making them just different format for the same information model.  An HTML rendering of the same GML/XML can choose to represent part of the information model, for example, skipping the explicit unit of measure.  It's still the same information set. No new information is added.  Note that transforming the data into some other data, like calculating an average, is not considering "new information".  It's derived information.  A last example is a PNG image of a well log, generated from the data contained in the information set.  The process is destructive as there is no direct way to turn the png back into the original information.  But it's still considered the same "representation" for GSIP because it a view of the same information set.

On the other hand, the same catchment description from two different sources will rarely have the same information set.  They can partially overlap. A the geometry for a catchment defined from dbpedia will likely be different, properties should be similar, but not identical:  either not the same precision, or simply because they are defined slightly differently.  They will in most cases be availably in the same formats, but with different information model, or different data content.

A representation will often coincide with a data source (from a single provider) who will tend to derive several formats from the same data. In a nutshell, all those formats are based on the same information.

==== Example

Consider https://geoconnex.ca/id/swmonitoring/WSC_02OJ016, a surface water monitoring station. This has two representations

image::img/rep_02OJ016.png[HTML landing page for a monitoring station]

The first representation is historical data, available in two formats (HTML and GeoJSON) and the other is daily data, available in HTML and plain text.
In this particular case, the data comes from the same source (https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca), but they are not transformations one of the other.

== Architecture

GSIP is composed of 3 modules.

* The RDF catalog
* The dynamic content generator module (optional)
* The data content negotiation module (optional)

The central goal of the GSIP service is to generate `/info/` resources from a `/id/` resource.  An fully functional system can be created by filling all the required information into the RDF catalog. GSIP provides additional features to a) reduce the size of the RDF database by providing ways to generate properties by deriving from existing content and b) harmonize access to representations (`/data/`).

=== RDF catalog

GSIP keeps information about `things` in a RDF catalog.  The catalog is queried using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL[SPARQL]
GSIP can connect to an external (autonomous) catalog, as long as it exposed a SPARQL endpoint, or use an internal catalog.  The internal catalog is loaded in memory, so this option should restricted to small datasets. (TODO: define what small means)

==== RDF Data model

A typical entry for a `thing` looks like this (examples are in  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)[RDF/turtle])

First, identification of the `thing` itself.

== Interactions

GSIP mediator processes URI based on their pattern. Some URI trigger special behaviors (/id/, /info/ and /data/) which are discussed below.  GSIP also exposes two API URI (/api/ and /resource/) which are not discussed at this point.
In all cases, the client provides a preferred format for the response (eg. text/html) and GSIP mediator will consider it.

=== /id/...

GSIP will rewrite the URI into a /info/ URI and respond to the client with a HTTP 303 seeAlso to the /info/ URIs


[source,bash]
----
$ curl -I https://geoconnex.ca/id/catchment/02OJ*CB
% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

HTTP/1.1 303
Date: Wed, 16 May 2018 22:28:55 GMT
Server: Apache
Location: https://geoconnex.ca/info/catchment/02OJ*CB
----

Note the Location: field with the /info/ url.  The client is expected to follow the 303 link and request the same format. Therefore, if the client asks for `https://geoconnex.ca/id/catchment/02OJ*CB` in HTML, it will also ask `https://geoconnex.ca/info/catchment/02OJ*CB` in HTML.

`f` and `callback` query parameters are transfered to the /info/ URL (See format override and callback sections for more info)

=== /info/

When GSIP get an /info/ url, the following steps are executed.

The /info/ is reverted to /id/ URI.  This URI is used to query the RDF catalog.

A SPARQL query is send to the catalog to extract basic information.  The SPARQL is built from a FreeMarker template located in

.template/describe.ftl
[source,sparql]
----
PREFIX rdfs:  <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>
CONSTRUCT {<${resource}> ?p ?o. ?o rdfs:label ?o2. ?o dct:format ?o3}
WHERE {<${resource}> ?p ?o. OPTIONAL {?o rdfs:label ?o2}. OPTIONAL {?o dct:format ?o3}. }
LIMIT 100
----

`${resource}`` is substituted with the /id/ resource. This query basically extract all properties of the resource of interest and for the properties whose values are also resources, get all their properties.
In other words, it get a all the nested values two levels down.

(I don't remember why I explicitly constructed  rdfs:label and dct:format instead of grabbing everything)

The template can be changed if needed.

At this point, the mediator checks if dynamic statements can be generated.  It checks if the context resource matches any of the patterns provided in dynamic/conf.xml.  If a pattern matches, it will use the associated template to create new statements from elements of the context resource URI.
The new statements are added to the model extracted from the RDF catalog (it can be empty) and then serialized according to the format requested by the client.

If the requested format is HTML, and extra template is used to transform the model into a HTML document (a landing page) before serializing the result to the client.

=== /data/

The role of GSIP mediator is to turn a /data/ URL into another URL and redirect the client to the new location (or, in some cases, act as a reverse proxy and stream the file to the client).

The mediator check in the data folder for a pattern that matches the /data/ URL and the format requested (eg, geojson). If a matches exist, it uses the associated FreeMarker template and rewrites a new URL. This new URL is either a) sent back to the client as a HTTP 303 see seeAlso, or the mediator pulls the content from the remote server and streams the file as-is to the client.

== /node/

WARNING: this is only available in the `selfie` branch (https://github.com/NRCan/GSIP/tree/selfie) for now.

The `/node/` endpoint is a utility service to extract information from the RDF catalog.  The information to be extracted is configured by providing SPARQL queries that are executed against the RDF catalog.  

Dereferencing the URL will execute a SPARQL query located in the `/templates` folder. The template name must start with `node_` (to avoid invoking a template that won't generate a proper SPARQL query)

The service is invoked with

http://{service}:{port}/gsip/node/{template}

`{template}` refers to a template named `node_{template}.ftl` in the `templates` folder

Content negotiation and format override (f={format}) apply. The content is available in RDF/XML, Turtle and JSON-LD.

=== SPARQL query template

The template can be any SPARQL query.  Since this is a FreeMarker template, any freemarker command can be used.  At this point, there are not parameters passed to the template (it could change in the future).  

To be proper RDF, the SPARQL query MUST be a https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#construct[CONSTRUCT] query. https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#select[SELECT] doesn't generate RDF graphs. 


.very simple sparql query that extracts all statement with `<https://geoconnex.ca/id/connectedTo>` predicate
[source,sparql]
----
# get all the triples that has drains-into relationship
CONSTRUCT {?s <https://geoconnex.ca/id/connectedTo> ?o.}
WHERE {?s <https://geoconnex.ca/id/connectedTo> ?o}
----
 
.More complex query that extracts all statement where the subject and the object are IRI (URIs) and they both start with `https://geoconnex.ca`

[source,sparql]
----
# get all triple that has a resource as an object and either subject or object are non local (not geoconnex)
CONSTRUCT {?s ?p ?o.}
WHERE {?s ?p ?o. 
FILTER (isIRI(?s) &&  isIRI(?o)
  && 
!(
	STRSTARTS(STR(?s),"https://geoconnex.ca") 
	&& 
	STRSTARTS(STR(?o),"https://geoconnex.ca")
 )
)
}
----

Note that the RDF catalog ALWAYS contains persistant URI, event if you are running in local mode (http://localhost for instance).  The translation is done at the serialisation.  So, SPARQL must be created as if the system was in production.

WARNING: There is an important caveat.  On the fly statements (see dynamic) won't be included since they are not physically in the RDF catalog.  




==== Configuration

GSIP can use an external SPARQL endpoint or has its own internal RDF catalog.

This location of the catalog is specified in the configuration file.
A value starting by http or https is considered as a SPARQL endpoint. Otherwise, GSIP considers that it is a pointer to a folder containing a collection or TTL (Turtle) files providing the database content, which be loaded when the service is started.


[source,xml]
----
<p:parameter name="gsip">http://localhost:9999/bigdata/namespace/kb/sparql</p:parameter>
----

===== BlazeGraph

The example above points to the "default" blazegraph endpoint.  Note that the blazegraph documentation mentions that the default endpoint is

`http://localhost:9999/bigdata/sparql` (port depends of configuration)

but Jena complains with a 404.  You can find the correct endpoint using

`curl localhost:9999/bigdata/namespace` to retrieve the endpoints.

[source,xml]

----
 
The sparqlEndpoint tag contains the correct endpoint.-

==== local stores

For development, testing or dealing with a small static triple store, it's possible to point to a local folder containing .ttl files

`webapp:` is a pseudo protocol telling GSIP the folder is located in the servlet webapp folder (here `{tomcat application folder}/gsip/webapp/repos/gsip`).

[source,xml]
----
<p:parameter name="triplestore">webapp:repos/gsip</p:parameter>
----

This is also useful when the only option to deploy the application and the data is through Tomcat application manager.

Note that GSIP will take some time at startup to load the .ttl files and compute inferrence.  Large dataset might exceed Tomcat timeout setting (at which point it will conclude the application failed to start).  You might have to boost (eg: https://docs.bmc.com/docs/ars91/en/increasing-the-shutdown-timeout-in-the-tomcat-configuration-tool-609073199.html)

== Folder structure

TODO: allow WebContent to be outside the application

The following folder are created at the root of the application (in addition to standard WEB-INF and META-INF)

* app
* conf
* data
* dynamic
* repos
* resources
* schemas
* templates

=== app : Application folder

This folder contains the demo application.  It is not technically part of the system.  It is used to demo or test the service. The resources (files) are exposed through `${baseUri}/gsip/app`.
The folder is not required to run the gsip service.

This folder goes through tomcat default servlet (just streams the data).  This is configured in web.xml

[source,xml]
----
<servlet-mapping>
  <servlet-name>default</servlet-name>
  <url-pattern>/app/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
----


=== conf: Configuration file

The configuration file sets values used by GSIP.

[source,xml]
----

----


It's made of two sections, the first section provides a list of format overrides and their mime-type (see Harmonised GET override).

The second section is a list of configuration keys used be the application.

.template variables
[options="header"]
|========
| Variable name | description |
| infoTemplate | freemarker template for HTML landing page |
| baseUri | Base URI in the current environment.  This base URI will be replace by persistentUri before it gets used in a query in the catalog |
| persistentUri | baseURI of the persistent URI in the catalog |
| gsip | Base URI of the gsip application, which may or may not be different from the baseURI of the resources in the catalog |
| triplestore | location of the RDF catalog (see section on RDF catalog) |
| supportedLanguages | comma delimited list of supported languages |
| defaultLanguage | assumed language |
|========

==== Environment variable

You can now pass environment variables which will be subsituted in the config file

[source,xml]
----
		<p:parameter name="baseUri">${GSIP_BASEURI}</p:parameter> 
 		<p:parameter name="gsip">${GSIP_APP}</p:parameter> 
		<p:parameter name="triplestore">${GSIP_TRIPLESTORE}</p:parameter>
----

You can use different names, just make sure they match the ones you pass.  For example, with docker, a local.env file is provided using the env above

.local.env
[source,txt]
----
GSIP_APP=http://localhost:8080/gsip
GSIP_BASEURI=http://localhost:8080/gsip
GSIP_TRIPLESTORE=webapp:repos/gsip
----

=== URI substitution mechanisms

Because the application works on the concept of resolving URI to representation, it means that /id/ URI are unique identifier AND location.  This can be a problem when the GSIP runs on a different location than the persistent URI.  Any resolution will immediately go to the persistent location instead of the location where GSIP is running.  This is obviously a problem when one tries to run GSIP in a developpement or a staging environment. It means that one needs to maintain different copies of the RDF catalog.

The confiuration allows instead of convert back and forth between the URI where GSIP is running and the persistent URI (the one that would normally be used in production).  The mediator will substitute baseUri to persistentUri before querying the database and substitute it back in the response.

For example, in a typical dev environment running on localhost, we can access this (persistent) URI

https://geoconnex.ca/id/catchment/02OJ*CB>

locally by replacing persistentUri value in configuration (https://geoconnex.ca) with baseUri (http://localhost:8080/gsip)

http://localhost.ca/id/catchment/02OJ*CB

this will go to the local GSIP application, which in turn will convert it back to query the RDF catalog (because the catalog always store persistent URI).

GSIP then converts the result back to baseUri, so when those URI are used in HTML or any other format, the client application (ie, HTML page for example) provides a link that goes back to the local instance of GSIP.

Moving the application from dev to staging to prod is just a matter of configuring the base URI properly.

Obsviously, this won't work if the RDF catalog  is used separatly.  This is really only a way to debug and test GSIP, not a permanent solution to deal with not so persistent URI.



=== data : /data/ content negotiation

This folder contains a series of XML files to manage the access to representations.    Depending of you data sources, you might or might not need this feature.  If a representation can be expressed as a single external resource, this can be encoded directly in the RDF catalog (as a `rdf:seeAlso`) or as dynamic content.
However, remote system rarely implement proper content negotiation, and remote system are notoriously heterogeneous.  The GSIP mediator can provide a URI for a representation by forcing the client to go through GSIP to get a representation and harmonize access to remote services.  It also deals with CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) and HTTPS/HTTP mixed environments.

==== provides a "clean" URL path by removing web services parameters

For example, it can proxy a complex WFS request

http://service.com/wfs?SERVICE=WFS&REQUEST=GetFeature&STOREDQUERY_ID=urn:ogc:def:query:OGC-WFS::GetFeatureById&ID=52

by

https://geoconnex.ca/data/aquifer/gwml/gwml/GIN/aq.52

==== provides a "reverse proxy" to deal with CORS and HTTPS/HTTP mix

Some external service might not authorise cross origin.  GSIP can be configures to act as a reverse proxy (get the content for you and stream it back to the client).


==== provides proper content negotiation over multiple formats

If multiple format are available for the same resourc, but from different sources, or using different API, GSIP can provide all those format under and single /data/ URI and provide content negotiation.

==== provides an harmonised GET override

As a convenience for people using a browser to access format non-HTML format, it is possible to override the content negotiation by providing an explicit request parameter.  Adding a `f=<format>` force GSIP to ignore the Accept HTTP header and provide the requested format.
Unfortunately, there are no standard list of format name, nor a single parameter name (f=, format=,mime-type=, etc..) .  By forcing client to go through GSIP mediation, it can enforce a uniform override.

The list of overrides is provided in the /conf/configuration.xml file.



Note there is another strategy commonly used is to use a well known extension (.xml for xml document).  But we felt this was to restrictive.



===  dynamic : Dynamic content

Dynamic content is used to generate extra content for NIR (`things`) resource based on the structure of the URI.  The principal goal is to avoid loading the RDF triple store with triple that can be derived automatically from the structure of the `thing` URI.  For example, from this URI

https://geoconnex.ca/id/waterwells/qc.1981_4671_100

the /data/ URI can be inferred by using the same id (qc.1981_4671_10)

https://geoconnex.ca/data/gwml/gwml1/gsip/gin/qc.1981_4671_10

One option is to load the RDF database with explicit statements

for each well.  For large database this will quickly add up.

Another option is to provide a template to generate the derivable content.  The following template uses FreeMarker (https://freemarker.apache.org/) to generate extra RDF predicate (in Turtle)


.waterwell.ftl
[source,xml]
----
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>.
<${resource}>
rdfs:seeAlso <${baseUri}/data/gwml/gwml1/gsip/gin/${p2}>;
<https://schema.org/name> "${p2}";
<https://schema.org/image> <http://ngwd-bdnes.cits.nrcan.gc.ca/Reference/uri-cgi/feature/gsc/waterwell/${p2?replace("qc.","ca.qc.gov.wells.")}?format=png>.
<${baseUri}/data/gwml/gwml1/gsip/gin/${p2}>
   rdfs:label "Information depuis RIES"@fr,"Information from GIN"@en;
	dct:format "text/xml","text/html","application/vnd.geo+json".
<#if hasStatements == 'false'>
<${resource}> rdfs:label "${p2}".
</#if>
----

The template is provided with a series of variables that can be used in the template.  Freemarker identifies substitution variable with `${variable name}`, and executable code between `<#XXX> </#XXX>` brackets.  FreeMarker is a rather complete templating language similar to PHP, ASP or JSP.

=== Variables

.template variables
[options="header"]
|========
| variable | description | example |
|resource |/id/ resource |  https://geoconnex.ca/id/waterwells/qc.1981_4671_100 |
|p1 | first element after /id/ | waterwells |
|p2 | second element after /id/ | qc.1981_4671_10 |
|p{n} | n element after /id/ | N/A in this case |
|baseUri* | baseUri as defined in configuration.xml | https://geoconnex.ca |
|hasStatements** | true is any statement exists in the RDF | 'true' |
|model| ModelWrapper object that gives you access RDF catalog results | (see Appendix C)|
|========

(*) all configuration parameters (`p:parameter`) defined in ``conf/configuration.xml` are available.  You can add more if needed, as long as they don't interfere with reserved parameters.
(**) The template can be used to create RDF on the fly even if there are no entry at all in the catalog.

The mapping between the templates and the URI mapping is provides in the conf.xml file in /dynamic/ folder.


 `<p:template name="watershed" pattern="^https?://.*/id/up_watershed/.*$" template="watershed.ftl" requiresEntry="false"/>`

 * name is a convenience label
 * pattern is a regex that matches a Non Information URI (/id/) and matches it to a template located in the template folder.
 * template is the name of the template in the template folder.
 * requiresEntry is a flag telling if a /id/ is needed in the catalog.  If "false", the template will be invoked even if no resource exists in the RDF catalog.

 Example:

.dynamic/conf.xml

=== repositories (repos)

The repositories can contain two kind of files.

   * A series of RDF files making the content of the RDF catalog.  Those files can be wither ttl or rdf files (files must have .rdf or .ttl extension)
   * import files, to fetch external content (must be ttl for now).  Import file can contain 0..* URLs pointing to ttl files on the web. Import files must have the extension `.imp`

The import file (.imp) is a simple text file with one URL per line.  Lines beginning with # are considered as comments

.repos/gsip/ext.imp

= Annex A : Modify the code

== Change the default URIs

The service use Jersey to handle endpoint, therefore it's simply a matter of changing `@Path` annotation to change the URI pattern.
[source,java]
----
package nrcan.lms.gsc.gsip;
// ...
@Path("/id/{seg:.*}")
public class NonInformationUri {
----

If your configure the web server (Apache modewrite), you also need to change that accordingly

== Change the SPARQL engine

The remote SPARQL enpoint is pretty much a single line of code in `nrcan.lms.gsc.gsip.triple.RemoteStore`



[source,java]
----
// perform a sparql query on a data store
	public Model getSparqlConstructModel(String sparql)
	{
		 Query query = QueryFactory.create(sparql);
			  try ( RDFConnection conn = RDFConnectionFactory.connect(sparqlRepo) ) {
		          return  conn.queryConstruct(query);
		        }
		 catch(Exception ex)
		 {
			 Logger.getAnonymousLogger().log(Level.SEVERE, "failed to execute [\n" + sparql + "]\n from " + sparqlRepo ,ex);

		 }
		 return null;

	}
----

To create another RemoteStore, just create your own class extending `TripleStoreImpl` or implementing `TripleStore` interface.  But whatever technology used, the result must be a Jena `Model`, so you might have to load the remote server response into a `Model` manually.
The procedure is rather trivial see: https://jena.apache.org/documentation/io/rdf-input.html.

The easiest way is
[source,java]
----
String rdfDataString = // some way to get RDF
Model model = ModelFactory.createDefaultModel();
model.read(new ByteArrayInputStream(rdfDataString.getBytes()), null);
----

= Annex B : Known issues

== Prefixes defined for persistent URI

Prefixes are often used to make URI more readable by replace to first portion of the uri by a small token.

for example : `rdfs` stands for `http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#` , therefore

`rdfs:label` is equivalent to http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#labels

It is tempting to apply the same logic to NIR URI by using a prefix to return

https://geoconnex.ca/id/aquifers/Richelieu into `aquifers:Richelieu` (assuming `aquifers` is bounded to https://geoconnex.ca/id/aquifers/).
Prefix aware format and software ingesting them should be perfectly fine with either representations.  But it's not clear what will happen for other formats.  Keep in mind that URI for things can appear anywhere (eg: in a geojson file as a regular string).  Because the string representing the resource is also a URL (a location on the web), prefixed string must be expanded to full URI before being used and it's not garantee web client application (often interacting in JSON) will execute this step.

for this reason, we suggest not using prefix for NIR until best practices are established.
(TODO: check if best practices exists)

= Annex C : ModelWrapper

ModelWrapper is an object used in some template to provide convenience function to extract information from a RDF model. It is rather minimal but can be extended.  The variable is a instance of ModelWrapper loaded with the current RDF model.  It is invoked using the familiar dot notation:

[source,java]
----
model.getPreferredLabel("en");
----

when inside `<#XX /#XX>` brackets or

[source,xml]
----
${model.getPreferredLable("en")}
----

if invoked directly in the body of the template.

Full list of function is available by looking at `nrcan.lms.gsc.gsip.model.ModelWrapper` source code. All public methods are available.

The ModelWrapper has a context Resource (the resource /id/ resource that was originally invoked), therefore a lot of function are duplicated:

- function accepting Jena Resource parameters
- function accepting Resource as a String
- function without Resource parameter, then the context Resource is implied.

= Annex D : Troubleshooting

== Tomcat unable to start within xx seconds

When launched within Eclipse, tomcat might not be able to start within the time allocated.
eg:

[source,text]
----
Server Tomcat v8.5 Server at localhost was unable to start within 45 seconds. If the server requires more time, try increasing the timeout in the server editor.
----

When gsip is using an internal RDF catalog (repo), it takes some times to load the content and compute inferrences.  You might need to boost the timeout values (in eclise in the "Servers" window, right-click and choose "Open") and look for the Timeouts tab.  The "Start" value is usually set to 45s.  Boost to 200 or more)
